homebrew-burka
==============

This is a Homebrew tap. It contains formulae that I need, mainly for my research, but that I don't see the need to submit to an official Homebrew tap (or, that I may have submitted but want to use before they are accepted).

How do I install these formulae?
================================

1. Install [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/). No really, install it. It's better than Macports and Fink. You'll love it.
2. Tap my repo: `brew tap durka/burka`. (`brew untap durka/burka` to undo)
3. Now you can install, e.g. `brew install aruco`. If there is a conflict with a formula in another tap then you can do `brew install durka/burka/aruco`.
